There's a voice I always trust
It's friendly helping hand tells me leave, I must
'Cause I can't stay forever (ah-ah)
'Cause I can't stay forever (ah-ah)
By my window
'Cause I can't stay forever
'Cause I can't stay forever
Ah, ah, ah
Rather chase a gentle breeze
Set my thoughts by taller trees
'Cause I can't stay forever (ah-ah)
'Cause I can't stay forever (ah-ah)
By my window
'Cause I can't stay forever
'Cause I can't stay forever
Ah, ah, ah
I need whispers that make me move
(I need whispers that make me move)
Riding the country for driving's sake
(Riding the country for driving's sake)
Sync me within the outside world
(Sync me within the outside world)
So I can better miss my home
(So I can better miss my home)
