I used to drive you home
But now I just drive you crazy
You used to call my phone
But you've been
a little quiet lately
Uh-huh
I know I ran like lightning
Didn't I? Didn't I?
I know
your dad's a piece of work
You got a deal you don't deserve
Yeah
And if I could rewind
to every Rock City night
We had a love without borders
And I still want to fight
in your corner
But I'm a flight risk
So I put my fist
through the wall
'Cause I've been falling
too short
Say the word and I'll call
Say the word and I'm coming back
I put my fist
through the wall, I
Know that you deserve more
Say the word and I'll call
Say the word and I'm coming
Back to your house
To get wasted
I've been playing dead for
too long
I've been playing dead for too
Back to your house
You're sacred
I've been playing dead for
too long
Yeah
In my defence,
you should never trust a girl
Who sleeps on a mattress
on the floor
And has a thousand
unread messages
Yeah, I know I dropped the ball
And what I did was criminal
I just hope you don't hate me
I used to drive you home
And now I just drive you crazy
Huh
So I put my fist
through the wall
'Cause I've been falling
too short
Say the word and I'll call
Say the word and I'm coming back
I put my fist
through the wall, I
Know that you deserve more
Say the word and I'll call
Say the word and I'm coming
Back to your house
To get wasted
I've been playing dead for
too long
I've been playing dead for too
Back to your house
You're sacred
I've been playing dead for
too long
