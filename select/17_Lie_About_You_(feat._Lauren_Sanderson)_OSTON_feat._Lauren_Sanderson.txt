Could you please just put the coffee down
It's two in the morning and I'm already ready for bed
Went to turn the TV down
Hand me the remote but both of the batteries were dead

Couldn't make decisions,
Thought I needed your permission
So I don't drink black coffee now
Don't know how it didn't taste so bitter back then

And if your friends all see it
Your boyfriend sees it
Even your mamma sees it, maybe you should believe it
And I ain't got no reason
To be mistreated at all

So why do I why do I why do I lie
Lie about you
Why do I why do I why do I try
Pretending I'm cool, when I'm not
Cuz everyone told me what I couldn't see
I tried to deny you were hurting me
I know I shouldn't, so why do I lie
Lie about you

Would you please just put the bottle down
You're already blacked out, messed up, saying stuff that you regret
I try my best to zone it out
But we both know that you're just gonna do this stuff again
I'm done submitting to all your decisions
So I don't even go out now
Don't know how I trust in love felt so different back then

And if your friends all see it
Your girlfriend sees it
Even your mamma sees it, maybe you should believe it
And I ain't got no reason
To be mistreated at all

So why do I why do I why do I lie
Lie about you
Why do I why do I why do I try
Pretending I'm cool, when I'm not
Cuz everyone told me what I couldn't see
I tried to deny you were hurting me
I know I shouldn't, so why do I lie
Lie about you

Lie, lie, lie about you
Said why do I lie?
Lie, lie, lie about you

Lie about you
Cry about you
Promise I wont change another thing about myself for you
Cuz it's true
I wish this never happened at all

Lie about you
Cry about you
If you were me then what would you do
Cuz without you
This never would've happened at all (at all)

So why do I why do I why do I lie
Lie about you
Why do I why do I why do I try
Pretending I'm cool, when I'm not
Cuz everyone told me what I couldn't see
I tried to deny you were hurting me
I know I shouldn't, so why do I lie
Lie about you (Why do I lie)

I don't wanna lie about you
I don't wanna cry about you
I don't wanna lie about you
I don't wanna cry (cry about you)

Lie, lie, lie about you
I know I shouldn't, so why do I lie
Lie about you
